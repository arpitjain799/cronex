CHANGELOG

2010.11.16; Tuesday
    The epoch is now a six element tuple. The last element represents
    offset from UTC. CronexExrepssion.check_trigger now uses a tuple
    for the date and accepts and additional option for UTC offset.

    Documentation removed from the docstring.

2010.11.15; Monday
    My implementation's handling the day of the month and day of the week was
    incorrect:

        $ man 5 crontab

        > Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two
        > fields - day of month, and day of week. If both fields are
        > restricted (i.e., aren't *), the command will be run when either
        > field matches the current time. For example, "30 4 1,15 * 5" would
        > cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each
        > month, plus every Friday.

    Unit test added to reflect the above change. I now know why some versions
    of cron use a "?" in the dom / dow fields.

    Added unit tests for month and day of the week substitution.

    Realized I broke L, W, # checking before the initial commit. Fixed and
    unit testing added for L in dow and dom fields.

    Renamed some variables.

2010.11.14; Sunday
    First version is done, unit tested, and documented.
