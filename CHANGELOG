CHANGELOG

2010.11.25; Thursday
    Nicer exception is raised when the number of fields in the CronExpression 
    is too short.

2010.11.21; Sunday
    CronExpression now validates the syntax of special characters "L", "W",
    and "#". The unit tests have been changed to reflect this. A new
    function, "is_special_atom", was created in the process of making this
    change.

2010.11.17; Wednesay
    Improvements in the unit tests.

    Moved the original README.markdown to a documentation folder and renamed
    it to SYNTAX.

    Documentation revamped.

2010.11.16; Tuesday
    The epoch is now a six element tuple. The last element represents offset
    from UTC. CronexExrepssion.check_trigger now uses a tuple for the date and
    accepts and additional option for UTC offset.

    Documentation removed from the module docstring. Method docstrings
    augmented with a bit more information.

    Exception now raised if "*" is used with other elements in the same field.

    Periodic triggers in the field for days of the week is properly
    implemented but may not be documented or tested.

    Unit tests should now cover all basic cases; finshed W and # unit tests.

2010.11.15; Monday
    My implementation's handling the day of the month and day of the week was
    incorrect:

        $ man 5 crontab

        > Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two
        > fields - day of month, and day of week. If both fields are
        > restricted (i.e., aren't *), the command will be run when either
        > field matches the current time. For example, "30 4 1,15 * 5" would
        > cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each
        > month, plus every Friday.

    Unit test added to reflect the above change. I now know why some versions
    of cron use a "?" in the dom / dow fields.

    Added unit tests for month and day of the week substitution.

    Realized I broke L, W, # checking before the initial commit. Fixed and
    unit testing added for L in dow and dom fields.

    Renamed some variables.

2010.11.14; Sunday
    First version is done, unit tested, and documented.
